# GAZEBO task

My laptop is not powerful enough to support SOLIDWORKS, Blender and the like. Thus I followed the Gazebo tutorial to make a simple diff-drive robot and apply controls to that.

I was able to utilize the previous (turtlesim) task to control the bot on a football pitch with obstables and have shared a screencast of the same.

The stuttering in the video is due to the laptop hanging and not due to the controls (sorry you couldn't enjoy the goal :3)
